# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
Louis' play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal. She wants to know how different Kickstarter plays fared based on launch date and the success rate of Kickstarter plays based on goals. Historical data from plays on Kickstarter was analyzed using excel. Outcomes based on Launch Date and Outcomes based on Goal Amount were visualized using excel.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis
1. Filter data based on plays:

The category and subcaterogy column was separated into parent category and subcategory then filtered by the subcategory plays using text to columns under the data tab in excel. The data launched was converted from unix timestamp to mm/dd/yyyy format then the year was extracted. The following excel formula were used: 
```
=(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)
=YEAR(S2)
```
J column was the unix timestamp and S column was the conversion to mm/dd/yyyy.

2. Find the number of outcomes based on launch date and goal amount

A pivot table was created to find the outcomes based on launch date. In the pivot table, Parent Category and Years was added to filter, Outcomes added to columns, Data Created Conversion added to Rows and Count of outcomes added to Values. The results of the pivot table were visualized in a line chart.

A new table was created to find the outcomes based on goal amount. In the table, the goals column was filled with ranges of different amounts. Then using countifs, the columns number successful, number failed, and number canceled were filled. For example,
```
=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D, "<1000",Kickstarter!F:F,"successful",Kickstarter!R:R,"plays")
=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!D:D, ">=1000",Kickstarter!D:D,"<5000",Kickstarter!F:F,"successful",Kickstarter!R:R,"plays")
```
Then total projects were calculated then percentage successful, percentage failed, and percentage canceled were calculated. The results were visualized with a line chart.

3. Visualize the results

Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date was visualized in a line chart.

Outcomes vs Goals was visualized in a line chart.

### Challenges
Challenges faced were verifying the results made sense. In order to make sense of the results, the results need to be checked. Since the data is in another sheet, the data was filtered the same way using filters and then the filtered data was counted. Thus the results can be verified. By verifying the results, errors and mistakes can be eliminated in the analysis.

## Results
### Conclusions for Outcomes Based on Launch Date
1. The most successful outcomes launch in May.
2. The most failed outcomes launch in October.

### Conclusion for Outcomes vs Goals
1. The most succesful outcomes have a goal less than 5000.

### Limitations
Limitations of the data set are currencies conversions and date launched. Currency conversion for different countries was not performed on the dataset. It is unknown if a conversion was even completed. Also the dataset's most recent lanuch date is in 2017. It is appropriate to update the dataset to most recent Kickestarter projects since Louis is funding the play "Fever" today. One limitation that is critical to analysis is the small sample size of large goal(greater than 50000) projects. Thus gathering more data of large goal projects is recommended.

### Recommendation
A recommendation for the results is to have a bar chart of number of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes vs goals. The problem with percentage is that the number of outcomes is unknown. The range 40000 to 44999 is 100% failed even though there is 1 project in that goal range. The range 5000 to 9999 has a lower successful percentage than 35000 to 39999 but range 5000 to 9999 has 93 successful plays and range 35000 to 39999 has 4 successful plays. It is easier to convey that range 5000 to 9999 is more successful with a larger sample size.
